# This folder contains our own patches for some packages
Libraries don't always work properly. :(

## How to add patch
1. Look for the breaking code and edit it to suit you.
2. Save and copy the whole package you editted to the node_modules_patches/ folder
3. Add " cp -R your_patch_package/ ../node_modules/ " to the patch.sh script in the node_modules_patches/
4. Run npm install.

## Patch Log
### Expo-location@8.3.0
1. Expo-location@8.3.0 package seems to have a race condition when using getHeadingAsync(), fix by making sure subscription is not undefined before calling its remove() func. (This patch does not break or conflict anything at the moment).

2. Also added try catch to Expo-location services/LocationTaskService.java onStartCommand() to prevent app crashing when gps permissions changed in background on runtime.
